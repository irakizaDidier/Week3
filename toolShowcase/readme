## Project Description

Build Tool Showcase is a simple web application designed to demonstrate the use of various build tools and package managers in a web development environment. It displays a list of popular build tools, utilizes modern JavaScript features (ES6+), and implements best practices for web development, including dependency management, build configuration, and optimization.

This project is part of the Week 0.1 Lab Activity and focuses on using Webpack as the build tool, npm as the package manager, and various other tools like Babel, Sass, Jest, and ESLint.
