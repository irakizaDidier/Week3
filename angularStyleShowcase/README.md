## Project Description

This Angular application demonstrates advanced SCSS features, a component-based architecture, and responsive design techniques. It includes a theme system with light and dark modes, custom SCSS functions, mixins, and a custom Angular directive for interactive styling.

## Setup and Run Instructions

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Use `ng serve --open` to run the application locally.

## SCSS Architecture and Features

The application uses SCSS for styling, with organized partials for variables, mixins, functions, and components. Key features include:

- **Variables:** For colors, fonts, and spacing.
- **Nesting:** For component-specific styles.
- **Mixins:** For reusable style patterns like flexbox layouts.
- **Functions:** For dynamic calculations, such as converting px to rem.
- **Extend/Inheritance:** For sharing common styles across components.
- **Partials:** To keep styles organized and maintainable.
